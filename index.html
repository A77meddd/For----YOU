            <h2>Ramadan Kareem<br>
                <span>
                    Every year, you are fine and always well ‚ù§Ô∏è <br>
                    Every Ramadan we are together and fine and it will be a beautiful month and it will pass by well <br>
                    This may be the happiest time really, you are more precious to me than anyone else and I am happy that we are fine with each other. <br>
                    There is really nothing that stays the same, I mean last year was different from last year at all, although we talked for a while but intermittently, there was no time the vacation passed well but Al-Muradi, there is no quarrel or anything and we stay like this forever and I will always be by your side and have your back all the time ‚ù§Ô∏è <br>
                    And it is not a simple thing that will make me upset with you, I may get mad at you sometimes but come on, I am stupid and bearable üòÇ
And even if anything happens, I will never react with you without talking to you first because you are kind and I know you do not mean it, but I will always understand you first <br>
